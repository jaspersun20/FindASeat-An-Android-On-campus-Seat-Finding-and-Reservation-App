2.In case the app doesn't run, change the sdk.dir line to your own in local.properties file under Gradle Script directory

3.User account credentials (username/password) that you have already created, through which we can log in:
   
   User1: uscid: 3563018064 password: 123123
   User2: uscid: 1111111111 password 123123
   User3: uscid: 2222222222 password: 123123
   User4: uscid: 3333333333 password: 123123
   User5: uscid: 4444444444 password: 123123
   Note: USC id must be a 10 digit number

4.Any specific problems you believe that we might face due to certain API restrictions (e.g. Firebase, Google Maps)
   Since our Firebase database was created with USC credentials, the app must operate under USC Wi-Fi or via USC VPN (vpn.usc.edu). 
   We apologize for any inconvenience.
   After registration, users will not be logged in automatically. The button in the top left corner allows you to return to the previous 
   page or to the map page, while the top right corner button navigates to the profile page. Users will need to log in again.
   Users also must log in to make reservations or view their profiles. On the profile page, users can directly edit their name and email. 
   On the map, reservation, and profile pages where scrolling is necessary, users must click and drag the screen to fully navigate through the pages.


Improved capabilities since Project 2.4ï¼š
Implemented photo upload for profiles
Implemented direct modifying of reservation in the profile tab
Modified Reservation Logic:
After the modification, the group allowed the user to select a 30-minute reservation within opening hours and a consecutive reservation up to 2 hours within opening hours. 
The group disallowed the user to select a reservation with non-consecutive slots or a reservation with longer than 2 hours or a reservation outside opening hours, or a reservation before current time.
